# Object-Counting-Using-a-Custom-YOLOv8-Model

A sophisticated object counting system was created to track packets on a factory conveyor belt. Integrating YOLOv8 for detection, ByteTrack for tracking, and Supervision for real-time oversight, the system adeptly handles industrial complexities. Tested on a video of milk packets at a Starbucks factory, it showed exceptional accuracy and efficiency. This project demonstrates a skill in applying advanced computer vision technologies to practical solutions.
